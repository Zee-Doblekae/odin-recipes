# odin-recipes
Creating a basic recipes website with HTML only. I will create 3 recipes all with there own page and respective links going to and from the Index page. All recipes will include...
-An image of the final recipe
-A link returning user to index.html
-Description of the recipes
-A heading
-An ordered and unordered list.

I am going to reinforce what I have learned about HTML in this project. Im sure I will forget some things but I will relearn them and grow as a developer. Anyways... pretty hyped.
